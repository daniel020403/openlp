    <verse name="c1a">
      <lines>Because He lives I can face tomorrow;<br/>Because He lives all fear is gone;</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1b">
      <lines>Because I know He holds the future,<br/>And life is worth the living just because He lives.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1a">
      <lines>God sent his Son, they called him Jesus;<br/>He came to love, heal, and forgive;</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1b">
      <lines>He lived and died to buy my pardon,<br/>An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2a">
      <lines>How sweet to hold a newborn baby,<br/>And feel the pride, and joy he gives;</lines>

    <verse name="v2b">
      <lines>But greater still the calm assurance,<br/>This child can face uncertain days<br/>because He lives.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3a">
      <lines>And then one day I'll cross the river;<br/>I'll fight life's final war with pain;</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3b">
      <lines>And then as death gives way to vict'ry,<br/>I'll see the lights of glory and I'll know he lives.</lines>
