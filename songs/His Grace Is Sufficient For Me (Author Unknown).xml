      <lines>Oh, His grace is sufficient for me<br/>And His love is abundant and free</lines>
    </verse>

      <lines>And what joy fills my soul just to know, just to know<br/>That His grace is sufficient for me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2a">
      <lines>When the tempter brings confusion and I don't know what to do<br/>On my knees I turn to Jesus <br/>For I know He'll see me through</lines>
