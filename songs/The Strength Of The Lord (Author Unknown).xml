    <verse name="v1a">
      <lines>Sometimes life seems like words and music<br/>that can't quite become a song;<br/>So we cry and sigh; then we try again,<br/>and wonder what could go wrong.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1b">
      <lines>But when we turn to the LORD at the end of ourselves,<br/>life we've done a time or two before,<br/>We find His truth is the same as it's always been;<br/>We never will need more.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>It's not in trying but in trusting,<br/>Not in running but in resting,<br/>Not in wond'ring but in praying,<br/>That we find the strength of the Lord</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2a">
      <lines>He's all we need for our every need;<br/>We never need be alone.<br/>Still, He'll let us go if we choose to,<br/>To live life on our own.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2b">
      <lines>Then the only good that will ever be said<br/>of the pains we'll find ourselves in;<br/>They are places to gain the wisdom to say,<br/>"I'll never leave Him again!"</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>That we find the strength of the Lord.</lines>
