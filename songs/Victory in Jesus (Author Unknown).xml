    <verse name="c1a">
      <lines>O victory in Jesus, <br/>my Savior, forever <br/>He sought me and bought me<br/>with His redeeming blood.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1b">
      <lines>He loved me ere I knew Him, <br/>and all my love is due Him, <br/>He plunged me to victory <br/>beneath the cleansing flood.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1a">
      <lines>I heard an old, old story, <br/>how a Savior came from glory,<br/>How He gave His life on Calvary <br/>to save a wretch like me;</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1b">
      <lines>I heard about His groaning, <br/>of His precious blood’s atoning, <br/>Then I repented of my sins <br/>and won the victory.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2a">
      <lines>I heard about His healing, <br/>of His cleansing pow’r revealing, <br/>How He made the lame to walk<br/>gain and caused the blind to see;</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2b">
      <lines>And then I cried, “Dear Jesus, <br/>come and heal my broken spirit”.<br/>And somehow Jesus came <br/> and bro’t to me the victory.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3a">
      <lines>I heard about a mansion<br/>He has built for me in glory,<br/>And I heard about the streets of<br/>gold beyond the crystal sea;</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3b">
      <lines>About the angels singing, <br/>and the old redemption story,<br/>And some sweet day I’ll sing<br/>up there the song of victory.</lines>
    </verse>
