    <verse name="v1a">
      <lines>Crown Him with many crowns,<br/>The Lamb upon His throne.<br/>Hark! how the heavenly anthem drowns</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1b">
      <lines>All music but its own!<br/>Awake, my soul and sing<br/>Of Him who died for Thee;<br/>And hail Him as thy matchless King<br/>Through all eternity.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2a">
      <lines>Crown Him the Lord of love:<br/>Behold His hands and side,<br/>Rich wounds, yet visible above,<br/>In beauty glorified;</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2b">
      <lines>No angel in the sky<br/>Can fully bear that sight,<br/>But downwards bends His wondering eye<br/>At mysteries so bright.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3a">
      <lines>Crown Him the Lord of life,<br/>Who triumphed o'er the grave.<br/>Who rose victorious to the strife,<br/>For those He came to save.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3b">
      <lines>His glories now we sing,<br/>Who died and rose on high.<br/>Who died eternal life to bring,<br/>And lives that death may die.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4a">
      <lines>Crown Him the Lord of peace,<br/>Whose pow'r a scepter sways<br/>From pole to pole,<br/>That wars may cease<br/>And all be prayer and praise;</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4b">
      <lines>His reign shall know no end,<br/>And round His pierced feet<br/>Fair flowers of paradise extend<br/>Their fragrance ever sweet.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5a">
      <lines>Crown Him the Lord of years,<br/>The Potentate of time;<br/>Creator of the rolling spheres,<br/>Ineffably sublime.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5b">
      <lines>All hail, Redeemer, hail!<br/>For Thou hast died for me.<br/>Thy praise and glory shall not fail<br/>Throughout eternity.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6a">
      <lines>Crown Him the Son of God<br/>Before the worlds began,<br/>And ye, who tread where He hath trod,<br/>Crown Him the Son of man;</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6b">
      <lines>Who every grief hath known<br/>That wrings the human breast,<br/>And takes and bears them for His own,<br/>That all in Him may rest.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7a">
      <lines>Crown Him the Lord of heaven:<br/>One with the Father known,<br/>One with the Spirit<br/>Through Him given</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7b">
      <lines>From yonder glorious throne.<br/>All hail, Redeemer, hail!<br/>For Thou hast died for me;<br/>Thy praise and glory shall not fail<br/>Throughout eternity.</lines>
