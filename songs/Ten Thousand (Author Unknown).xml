    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Ten Tousand Angels<br/>They bound the hands of Jesus in the garden where He prayed;<br/>They led Him thro' the streets in shame.<br/>They spat upon the Savior so pure and free from sin;</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>They said, "Crucify Him; He's to blame."<br/>He could have called ten thousand angels<br/>To destroy the world and set Him free.<br/>He could have called ten thousand angels,</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>But He died alone, for you and me.<br/>Upon His precious head they placed a crown of thorns;<br/>They laughed and said, "Behold the King!"<br/>They struck Him and they cursed Him</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>and mocked His holy name<br/>All alone He suffered everything.<br/>To the howling mob He yielded;<br/>He did not for mercy cry.<br/>The cross of shame He took alone.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>And when He cried, "It's finished," He gave Himself to die;<br/>Salvation's wondrous plan was done.<br/>He could have called<br/>Ten thousand angels</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>To destroy the world <br/>And set Him free.<br/>He could have called<br/>Ten thousand angels,<br/>But He died alone,</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>For you and me.<br/>He died alone, for you and me.<br/>He died for you,<br/>He died for me.</lines>
