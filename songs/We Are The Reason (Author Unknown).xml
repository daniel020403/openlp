    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>WE ARE THE REASON</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>As little children we would dream of Christmas morn</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Of all the gifts and toys we knew we’d find</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>But we never realized a baby born one blessed night</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Gave us the greatest gift of our lives</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>We were the reason that He gave His life</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>We were the reason that He suffered and died</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>To a world that was lost He gave all He could give</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v9">
      <lines>To show us the reason to live</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v10">
      <lines>As the years went by we learned more about gifts</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v11">
      <lines>The giving of ourselves and what that means<br/>On a dark and cloudy day a man hung crying in the rain</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v12">
      <lines>All because of love</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v13">
      <lines>I finally found the reason for living</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v14">
      <lines>It’s in giving every part of my heart to Him</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v15">
      <lines>In all that I do every word that I say</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v16">
      <lines>I'll be giving my all just for Him, for Him</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v17">
      <lines>And we are the reason that He gave His life</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v18">
      <lines>We are the reason that He suffered and died</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v19">
      <lines>To show us the reason…to live.</lines>
