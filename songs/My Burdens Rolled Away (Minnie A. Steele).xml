    </verse>
    <verse name="v1b">
      <lines>When I sought the blessed Lord<br/>And I took Him at His word,<br/>Then at once all my burdens rolled away.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2a">
      <lines>I remember when my burdens rolled away,<br/>That I feared would never leave night or day,</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2b">
      <lines>Jesus showed to me the loss,<br/>So I left them at the Cross;<br/>I was glad when my burdens rolled away.</lines>

    <verse name="v3a">
      <lines>I remember when my burdens rolled away,<br/>That had hindered me for years,<br/>Night and day.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3b">
      <lines>As I sought the throne of grace,<br/>Just a glimpse of Jesus' face,<br/>And I knew that my burdens<br/>Could not stay.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4a">
      <lines>I am singing<br/>Since my burdens rolled away;<br/>There's a song within my heart<br/>Night and day.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4b">
      <lines>I am living for my King,<br/>And with joy I shout and sing,<br/>Hallelujah!<br/>All my burdens rolled away!</lines>
