    <verse name="c1a">
      <lines>By and by when the morning comes, <br/>When the saints of God<br/>are gathered home,</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1b">
      <lines>We’ll tell the story <br/>how we've overcome;<br/>For we'll understand it better<br/>by and by.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1a">
      <lines>We are often tossed and driv’n <br/>on the restless sea of time,<br/>Sombre skies and howling tempests oft succeed a bright sunshine,</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1b">
      <lines>In that land of perfect day, <br/>when the mists have rolled away,<br/>We will understand it better<br/>by and by.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2a">
      <lines>We are often destitute <br/>of the things that life demands,<br/>Want of food and want of shelter<br/>thirsty hills and barren lands,</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2b">
      <lines>We are trusting in the Lord, and according to His word,<br/>We will understand it better<br/>by and by.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3a">
      <lines>Trials dark on ev’ry hand, <br/>and we cannot understand,<br/>All the ways that God would lead us to that blessed Promised Land;</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3b">
      <lines>But He guides us with His eye <br/>and we’ll follow till we die,<br/>For we’ll understand it better<br/>by and by.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4a">
      <lines>Temptations, hidden snares often take us unaware, <br/>And our hearts are made to bleed for many a thoughtless<br/>word or deed,</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4b">
      <lines>And we wonder why the test when we try to do our best,  <br/>But we’ll understand it better<br/>by and by.</lines>
