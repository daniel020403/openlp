    <verse name="v1a">
      <lines>Infant holy, infant lowly,<br/>For His bed a cattle stall;<br/>Oxen lowing, little knowing,<br/>Christ the babe is Lord of all.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1b">
      <lines>Swift are winging, angels singing,<br/>Noels ringing, tidings bringing:<br/>Christ the Babe is Lord of all.<br/>Christ the Babe is Lord of all.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2a">
      <lines>Flocks were sleeping,<br/>Shepherds keeping vigil<br/>Till the morning new;<br/>Saw the glory, heard the story,<br/>Tidings of a gospel true.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2b">
      <lines>Thus rejoicing, free from sorrow,<br/>Praises voicing, greet the morrow:<br/>Christ the Babe was born for you.<br/>Christ the Babe was born for you.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3a">
      <lines>In a manger He is lying,<br/>Who will greet Him as He sleeps?<br/>Baby Jesus, infant Christ child,</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3b">
      <lines>Who will greet Him as He sleeps?<br/>Angels winging, praises singing,<br/>Noels ringing, tidings bringing:<br/>Christ the Babe is Lord of all.<br/>Christ the Babe is Lord of all.</lines>
