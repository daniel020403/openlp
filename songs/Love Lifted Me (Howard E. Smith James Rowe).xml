    <verse name="c1a">
      <lines>Love lifted me!<br/>Love lifted me!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1b">
      <lines>When nothing<br/>else could help,<br/><br/>Love lifted me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1a">
      <lines>I was sinking deep in sin, far from the peaceful shore,<br/><br/>Very deeply stained within, sinking to rise no more.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1b">
      <lines>But the Master of the sea heard my despairing cry,<br/><br/>From the waters lifted me; now safe am I.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2a">
      <lines>All my heart to Him I give; ever to Him I'll cling,<br/><br/>In His blessed presence live, ever His praises sing.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2b">
      <lines>Love so mighty and so true merits my soul's best songs;<br/><br/>Faithful, loving service too, to Him belongs.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3a">
      <lines>Souls in danger, look above; Jesus completely saves.<br/><br/>He will lift you by His love out of the angry waves.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3b">
      <lines>He's the Master of the sea, billows His will obey.<br/><br/>He your Savior wants to be, be saved today.</lines>
    </verse>
