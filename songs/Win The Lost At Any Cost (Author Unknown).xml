    <verse name="v1a">
      <lines>Souls are crying, <br/>Men are dying.<br/>Won't you lead them to the cross?<br/>Go and find them,<br/>Help to win them,<br/>Win the lost at any cost.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2a">
      <lines>Go out and win, <br/>Rescue from sin,<br/>Day's almost done<br/>low sets the sun.<br/>Souls are crying,<br/>Men are dying,<br/>Win the lost at any cost.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1b">
      <lines>As we look around us<br/>All the fields are white<br/>Ripened unto harvest</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1c">
      <lines>And so swiftly comes the night;<br/>Christians must get busy<br/>There is work to do,<br/>Here's an urgent task awaiting you.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2b">
      <lines>Christ our loving Shepherd,<br/>went out from the fold<br/>Seeking for the stray lamb</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2c">
      <lines>That was lost in darkened cold;<br/>Tender hands of kindness<br/>Raised him from the ground,<br/>Now's the little lost one had been found.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3a">
      <lines>Check your fold my Christian,<br/>Are the children in?<br/>Are there yet some straying,</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3b">
      <lines>Lost in blackened fields of sin;<br/>You must go and reach them,<br/>Go without delay,<br/>Soon the shades of night<br/>will end the day.</lines>
    </verse>
