    <verse name="c1a">
      <lines>O victory in Jesus, <br/>my Savior, forever<br/><br/>He sought me and bought me with His redeeming blood.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1b">
      <lines>He loved me ere I knew Him, and all my love is due Him,<br/><br/>He plunged me to victory<br/>beneath the cleansing flood.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1a">
      <lines>I heard an old, old story, how a Savior came from glory,<br/><br/>How He gave His life on Calvary to save a wretch like me;</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1b">
      <lines>I heard about His groaning, of His precious blood’s atoning,<br/><br/>Then I repented of my sins and won the victory.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2a">
      <lines>I heard about His healing, of His cleansing pow’r revealing,<br/><br/>How He made the lame to walk again and caused the blind to see;</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2b">
      <lines>And then I cried, “Dear Jesus, come and heal my broken spirit.”<br/><br/>And somehow Jesus came and bro’t to me the victory.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3a">
      <lines>I heard about a mansion He has built for me in glory,<br/><br/>And I heard about the streets of gold beyond the crystal sea;</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3b">
      <lines>About the angels singing, and the old redemption story,<br/><br/>And some sweet day I’ll sing up there the song of victory.</lines>
    </verse>
