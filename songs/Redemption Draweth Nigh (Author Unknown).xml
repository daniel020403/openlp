    <verse name="v1a">
      <lines>Years of time have come and gone<br/>Since I first heard it told<br/>How Jesus would come again someday.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1b">
      <lines>If back then it seemed so realm<br/>Then I just can't help but feel<br/>How much closer His coming is today.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1a">
      <lines>Signs of the times are ev'ry where,<br/>And there's a brand new feeling in the air.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1b">
      <lines>Keep your eyes upon the eastern sky,<br/>Lift up your head,<br/>Redemption draweth nigh.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2a">
      <lines>Wars and strife on ev'ry hand<br/>And violence fills our land;<br/>Still some people doubt He'll come again.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2b">
      <lines>But the Word of God is true;<br/>He'll redeem His chosen few.<br/>Don't lose hope soon,<br/>Christ Jesus will descend.</lines>
    </verse>
