    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Years of time have come and gone<br/>Since I first heard it told<br/>How Jesus would come again some day,</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>If back then it seemed so real,<br/>Then I just can't help but feel<br/>How much closer His coming is today.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Wars and strife on ev'ry hand <br/>And violence fills our land;<br/>Still some people doubt</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>He'll come again.<br/>But the Word of God is true;<br/>He'll redeem His chosen few. <br/>Don't lose hope soon Christ Jesus will descend</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Signs of the times are ev'ry- where, <br/>And there's a brand new feeling in the air.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Keep your eyes up on the eastern sky,<br/>Lift up your head, <br/>Redemption draweth nigh.</lines>
    </verse>
