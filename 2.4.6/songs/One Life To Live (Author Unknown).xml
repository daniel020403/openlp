      <lines>So you think that you have plenty of time<br/>The road ahead seems long and it seems wide</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1b">
      <lines>But should the road you follow<br/>And suddenly tomorrow<br/>Would Jesus came to you"Will done my child"</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1a">
      <lines>For you've got one life to live let it be for Jesus<br/>You've got one life to live let it be for Him</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1b">
      <lines>You'll find that in your giving<br/>Your life will be worth living<br/>You've got one life to live<br/>Let it be for Him</lines>

    <verse name="v2a">
      <lines>You feel the day with the things that thrill you<br/>But soon you find that they don't fulfill you</lines>
    </verse>

      <lines>You feel His Spirits drawing<br/>There is a higher calling<br/>So give your all to Him<br/>His pleading will you?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1c">
      <lines>One life to live let it be for Jesus<br/>One life to live let it be for Him<br/>You'll find that in your giving<br/>Your life will be worth living</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1d">
      <lines>You've got one life to live let it be for Him<br/>Let it be for Jesus<br/>Let it be for God<br/>One life to live for God</lines>
