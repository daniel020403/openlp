    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>In the stars His handiwork I see,<br/>On the wind He speaks with majesty,<br/>Though He ruleth over land and sea,<br/>What is that to me?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I will celebrate Nativity,<br/>For it has a place in history,<br/>Sure, He came to set His people free,<br/>What is that to me?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Till by faith I met Him face to face,<br/>And I felt the wonder of His grace,<br/>Then I knew that He was more than just a <br/>God who didn't care,<br/>That lived a way out there and now He walks beside me day by day,<br/>Ever watching o'er me lest I stray,<br/>Helping me to find that narrow way,<br/>He's Everything to me.</lines>
