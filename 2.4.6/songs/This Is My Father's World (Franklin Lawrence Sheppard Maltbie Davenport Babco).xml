    <verse name="v1a">
      <lines>This is my Father's world,<br/>And to my listening ears;<br/>All nature sings and round me rings<br/>The music of the spheres.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1b">
      <lines>This is my Father's world;<br/>I rest me in the thought<br/>Of rocks and trees, of skies and seas;<br/>His hand the wonders wrought.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2a">
      <lines>This is my Father's world;<br/>The birds their carols raise.<br/>The morning light, the lily white,<br/>Declare their Maker's praise;</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2b">
      <lines>This is my Father's world;<br/>He shines in all that's fair;<br/>In the rustling grass I hear Him pass,<br/>He speaks to me everywhere.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3a">
      <lines>This is my Father's world,<br/>O let me ne'er forget<br/>That though the wrong seems oft so strong,<br/>God is the Ruler yet.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3b">
      <lines>This is my Father's world;<br/>The battle is not done;<br/>Jesus, who died, shall be satisfied,<br/>And earth and heaven be one.</lines>
    </verse>
