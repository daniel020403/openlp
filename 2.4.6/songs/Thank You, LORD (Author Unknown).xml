    <verse name="v1a">
      <lines>Thank you, Lord for the trials that come my way,<br/>In that way I can grow each day as I let You lead.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1b">
      <lines>And thank You, Lord for the patience those trials bring, <br/>In that process of growing I can learn to care.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1a">
      <lines>But it goes against the way I am to put my human nature down,<br/>And let the Spirit take control of all I do .</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1b">
      <lines>'Cause when those trials come, my human nature shouts the thing to do;<br/>And God's soft prompting can be easily ignored.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2a">
      <lines>I thank You Lord with each trial I feel inside,<br/>That you're there to help lead and guide me away from wrong,</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2b">
      <lines>'Cause You promised, Lord, that with ev'ry testing<br/>That Your way of escaping is easier to bear.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3a">
      <lines>I thank You, Lord for the vic'try that growing brings,<br/>In surrender of ev'rything life is so worth while.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3b">
      <lines>And I thank You Lord that when ev'rything's put in place,<br/>Out in  front I can see Your face and it's there You belong.</lines>
    </verse>
