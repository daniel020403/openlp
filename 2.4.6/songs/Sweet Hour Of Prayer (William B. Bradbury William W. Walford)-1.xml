    <verse name="v1a">
      <lines>Sweet hour of prayer,<br/>Sweet hour of prayer,<br/>That calls me from a world of care<br/>And bids me at my Father's throne</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1b">
      <lines>Make all my wants and wishes known.<br/>In seasons of distress and grief<br/>My soul has often found relief,<br/>And oft escaped the tempter's snare,<br/>By Thy return sweet hour of prayer.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2a">
      <lines>Sweet hour of prayer,<br/>Sweet hour of prayer.<br/>The joys I feel, the bliss I share.<br/>Of those whose anxious spirits burn</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2b">
      <lines>With strong desires for Thy return.<br/>With such I hasten to the place<br/>Where God, my Savior, shows His face.<br/>And gladly take my station there,<br/>And wait for Thee, sweet hour of prayer.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3a">
      <lines>Sweet hour of prayer,<br/>Sweet hour of prayer,<br/>Thy wings shall my petition bear<br/>To Him whose truth and faithfulness</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3b">
      <lines>Engage the waiting soul to bless;<br/>And since He bids me seek His face,<br/>Believe His word, and trust His grace,<br/>I'll cast on Him my ev'ry care.<br/>And wait for Thee, sweet hour of prayer.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4a">
      <lines>Sweet hour of prayer,<br/>Sweet hour of prayer,<br/>May I Thy consolation share,<br/>'Til from Mount Pisgah's lofty height,<br/>I view my home and take my flight.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4b">
      <lines>This robe of flesh<br/>I'll drop and rise<br/>To seize the everlasting prize,<br/>And shout while passing through the air,<br/>Farewell, farewell sweet hour of prayer.</lines>
    </verse>
